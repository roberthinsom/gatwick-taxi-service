        <h2>Assess Your Group Size</h2>

        <h3>Small Groups (1-4 People)</h3>
        <p>For small groups, standard taxis or minicabs are often sufficient. These vehicles are generally equipped to comfortably accommodate up to four passengers. If you’re traveling with just a couple of companions, a standard sedan or compact vehicle will usually provide enough space.</p>

        <h3>Medium Groups (5-6 People)</h3>
        <p>If your group consists of 5 to 6 people, you should consider opting for a larger vehicle. A minivan or a people carrier can provide ample space for everyone, ensuring a comfortable journey without feeling cramped. This option also allows for additional luggage space.</p>

        <h3>Large Groups (7+ People)</h3>
        <p>For larger groups of 7 or more, a minibus or a large van is the best choice. These vehicles offer more seating capacity and increased luggage space, making them ideal for groups who want to travel together without having to split up.</p>

        <h2>Evaluate Your Luggage Requirements</h2>

        <h3>Minimal Luggage</h3>
        <p>If you’re traveling light with just a few small bags, a standard taxi to Gatwick Airport will typically suffice. These vehicles are designed to handle a modest amount of luggage, making them a convenient option for solo travelers or couples.</p>

        <h3>Moderate Luggage</h3>
        <p>For those carrying a moderate amount of luggage, such as several medium-sized suitcases or a combination of bags, it’s important to choose a vehicle with sufficient trunk space. Consider booking a larger sedan or an estate car, which offer increased cargo capacity compared to standard taxis.</p>

        <h3>Heavy Luggage</h3>
        <p>Traveling with heavy or bulky luggage, such as large suitcases, sports equipment, or multiple bags, requires careful planning. Opt for a minivan or a large van that offers generous luggage space and can comfortably accommodate your gear. This will prevent any issues with fitting all your items and ensure a smoother ride.</p>

        <h3>Executive Taxis</h3>
        <p>For a more comfortable experience, consider booking an executive taxi to Gatwick Airport. These vehicles often come with additional amenities such as leather seats, extra legroom, and a more luxurious ride. They are well-suited for travelers who prefer a higher level of comfort.</p>

        <h3>Luxury Options</h3>
